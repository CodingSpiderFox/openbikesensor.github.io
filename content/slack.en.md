# Slack

We are trying to move away from Slack and towards free and open communication channels.

However, some topics still require the nature of Slack and have their place there for now, such as:

* short-term coordination
* event announcements
* community topics
* organizing of  collective orders
* some local groups

For topics like technical development, research projects, help and support and
much more, there is now a good place in the new [Discourse forum]({{< relref
"/community" >}}). Have a look there first ;)
