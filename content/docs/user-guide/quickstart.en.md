> This guide assumes that you have a working OpenBikeSensor. [If you don't, start here!]({{< ref "/docs/hardware" >}} "Hardware")

If you get an OpenBikeSensor, there are a few things you should check first.

1. Check if the OpenBikeSensor's display/button holder fits on your handlebars.
   There are basically two different kinds of handlebars: ones with a
   25.4mm diameter and others with a 31.8mm diameter. You may need to adapt your
   holder if your device is designed for 31.8mm and your handlebars are
   25.4mm, but the other way around is not possible.
2. Measure the distance between the outer edge of the device and the end of
   your handlebars. Enter this value into the configuration options.
3. Set your privacy zones. You can get the GPS location with any
   digital map app. Enter these values into the configuration options.
4. Check that the SD card is ok and - in the best case - empty.
5. Charge the device's battery.
6. Turn on your device and wait until it has found your GPS location. This
   might take some time while it locates the satellites. The
   display will exit the status screen as soon as your location is known.
   While moving, it might take up to 15 minutes until the device knows where you
   are. Stand still to make the process faster.
6. Put your sensor on the bike and go for a ride. Please watch out for
   traffic around you, and don't let the OpenBikeSensor distract you!
8. Push the button every time you are passed. It doesn't matter if it's a car,  truck, bus, 
   or motorbike. It's important to record every pass, not just the close ones, to better 
   understand how often close passes occur.
9. Remember to switch off the device after your ride. Hold the button on the display while
   throwing the switch to ensure you don't lose any data.
