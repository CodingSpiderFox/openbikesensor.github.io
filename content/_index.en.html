Build your own device. We will support you as much as we can. How about joining
a local group of builders and cyclists, and join a collective order to save on
parts?

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="Develop" url="https://github.com/openbikesensor" url_text="Zu den GitHub-Repositories" %}}
We publish everything we create as open source. Everything is available on GitHub,
including the software code, schematics, blueprints, CAD models, instructions
and documentation.

The OpenBikeSensor is a small electronic device attached to a bicycle that records
the distance to passing vehicles during the ride.

It's not a finished product, and you cannot purchase an OpenBikeSensor. But
there is plans and information available publicly to build your own. Have a
look at <a href="https://github.com/openbikesensor">Github</a>, where there are
repositories for the firmware, PCBs, the files for 3D printing the case, the
software for the frontend and backend of the data portal, and this
documentation page. <a href="{{< relref "/community" >}}">You're invited to join</a> and help develop the sensor.

In our data portal, users can upload data recorded with their OpenBikeSensors and
optionally share them as Open Data with the public.

## Visualisation

An important part of this project is enabling the analysis of the collected data.
That's why we write software to extract interesting values from the recorded
track files and visualise them.

Here we show an example visualisation of a number of overtaking manoeuvres and
their distances from Stuttgart, Germany. The values come from an experienced
cyclist who moves in traffic routinely with confidently. Of course this cyclist
was passed many times below the legal threshold of 1.5m, some measurements are
even as low as 50cm.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
{{< imgproc visualisierung Resize "800x" />}}
</div>

Another example shows a single overtaking, of which a video recording was
available as well. We overlay GPS information as well as the recorded sideways
distance to the passing vehicle. We hope presenting information in context like
this makes it easier to relate and get a feel for the danger the cyclist is
exposed to in this very moment.

If you have ideas for visualisation, automation, software and tool development
and analysis of the data available from the recorded tracks, or you're just
